Intersymbolic AI: Interlinking Symbolic AI and Subsymbolic AI,"  This perspective piece calls for the study of the new field of Intersymbolic
AI, by which we mean the combination of symbolic AI, whose building blocks have
inherent significance/meaning, with subsymbolic AI, whose entirety creates
significance/effect despite the fact that individual building blocks escape
meaning. Canonical kinds of symbolic AI are logic, games and planning.
Canonical kinds of subsymbolic AI are (un)supervised machine and reinforcement
learning. Intersymbolic AI interlinks the worlds of symbolic AI with its
compositional symbolic significance and meaning and of subsymbolic AI with its
summative significance or effect to enable culminations of insights from both
worlds by going between and across symbolic AI insights with subsymbolic AI
techniques that are being helped by symbolic AI principles. For example,
Intersymbolic AI may start with symbolic AI to understand a dynamic system,
continue with subsymbolic AI to learn its control, and end with symbolic AI to
safely use the outcome of the learned subsymbolic AI controller in the dynamic
system. The way Intersymbolic AI combines both symbolic and subsymbolic AI to
increase the effectiveness of AI compared to either kind of AI alone is likened
to the way that the combination of both conscious and subconscious thought
increases the effectiveness of human thought compared to either kind of thought
alone. Some successful contributions to the Intersymbolic AI paradigm are
surveyed here but many more are considered possible by advancing Intersymbolic
AI.

"A Survey on Verification and Validation, Testing and Evaluations of
  Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence","  Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging branch of AI that
combines the strengths of symbolic AI and sub-symbolic AI. A major drawback of
sub-symbolic AI is that it acts as a ""black box"", meaning that predictions are
difficult to explain, making the testing & evaluation (T&E) and validation &
verification (V&V) processes of a system that uses sub-symbolic AI a challenge.
Since neurosymbolic AI combines the advantages of both symbolic and
sub-symbolic AI, this survey explores how neurosymbolic applications can ease
the V&V process. This survey considers two taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI,
evaluates them, and analyzes which algorithms are commonly used as the symbolic
and sub-symbolic components in current applications. Additionally, an overview
of current techniques for the T&E and V&V processes of these components is
provided. Furthermore, it is investigated how the symbolic part is used for T&E
and V&V purposes in current neurosymbolic applications. Our research shows that
neurosymbolic AI as great potential to ease the T&E and V&V processes of
sub-symbolic AI by leveraging the possibilities of symbolic AI. Additionally,
the applicability of current T&E and V&V methods to neurosymbolic AI is
assessed, and how different neurosymbolic architectures can impact these
methods is explored. It is found that current T&E and V&V techniques are partly
sufficient to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the symbolic and sub-symbolic
part of neurosymbolic applications independently, while some of them use
approaches where current T&E and V&V methods are not applicable by default, and
adjustments or even new approaches are needed. Our research shows that there is
great potential in using symbolic AI to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the
predictions of a sub-symbolic model, making neurosymbolic AI an interesting
research direction for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.

Neurosymbolic AI for Situated Language Understanding,"  In recent years, data-intensive AI, particularly the domain of natural
language processing and understanding, has seen significant progress driven by
the advent of large datasets and deep neural networks that have sidelined more
classic AI approaches to the field. These systems can apparently demonstrate
sophisticated linguistic understanding or generation capabilities, but often
fail to transfer their skills to situations they have not encountered before.
We argue that computational situated grounding provides a solution to some of
these learning challenges by creating situational representations that both
serve as a formal model of the salient phenomena, and contain rich amounts of
exploitable, task-appropriate data for training new, flexible computational
models. Our model reincorporates some ideas of classic AI into a framework of
neurosymbolic intelligence, using multimodal contextual modeling of interactive
situations, events, and object properties. We discuss how situated grounding
provides diverse data and multiple levels of modeling for a variety of AI
learning challenges, including learning how to interact with object
affordances, learning semantics for novel structures and configurations, and
transferring such learned knowledge to new objects and situations.

"Re-imagining health and well-being in low resource African settings
  using an augmented AI system and a 3D digital twin","  This paper discusses and explores the potential and relevance of recent
developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twins for health and
well-being in low-resource African countries. We use the case of public health
emergency response to disease outbreaks and epidemic control. There is
potential to take advantage of the increasing availability of data and
digitization to develop advanced AI methods for analysis and prediction. Using
an AI systems perspective, we review emerging trends in AI systems and digital
twins and propose an initial augmented AI system architecture to illustrate how
an AI system can work with a 3D digital twin to address public health goals. We
highlight scientific knowledge discovery, continual learning, pragmatic
interoperability, and interactive explanation and decision-making as essential
research challenges for AI systems and digital twins.

"Trustworthy, Responsible, and Safe AI: A Comprehensive Architectural
  Framework for AI Safety with Challenges and Mitigations","  AI Safety is an emerging area of critical importance to the safe adoption and
deployment of AI systems. With the rapid proliferation of AI and especially
with the recent advancement of Generative AI (or GAI), the technology ecosystem
behind the design, development, adoption, and deployment of AI systems has
drastically changed, broadening the scope of AI Safety to address impacts on
public safety and national security. In this paper, we propose a novel
architectural framework for understanding and analyzing AI Safety; defining its
characteristics from three perspectives: Trustworthy AI, Responsible AI, and
Safe AI. We provide an extensive review of current research and advancements in
AI safety from these perspectives, highlighting their key challenges and
mitigation approaches. Through examples from state-of-the-art technologies,
particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), we present innovative mechanism,
methodologies, and techniques for designing and testing AI safety. Our goal is
to promote advancement in AI safety research, and ultimately enhance people's
trust in digital transformation.

"Creating a Gen-AI based Track and Trace Assistant MVP (SuperTracy) for
  PostNL","  The developments in the field of generative AI has brought a lot of
opportunities for companies, for instance to improve efficiency in customer
service and automating tasks. PostNL, the biggest parcel and E-commerce
corporation of the Netherlands wants to use generative AI to enhance the
communication around track and trace of parcels. During the internship a
Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is created to showcase the value of using
generative AI technologies, to enhance parcel tracking, analyzing the parcel's
journey and being able to communicate about it in an easy to understand manner.
The primary goal was to develop an in-house LLM-based system, reducing
dependency on external platforms and establishing the feasibility of a
dedicated generative AI team within the company. This multi-agent LLM based
system aimed to construct parcel journey stories and identify logistical
disruptions with heightened efficiency and accuracy. The research involved
deploying a sophisticated AI-driven communication system, employing
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced response precision, and
optimizing large language models (LLMs) tailored to domain specific tasks.
  The MVP successfully implemented a multi-agent open-source LLM system, called
SuperTracy. SuperTracy is capable of autonomously managing a broad spectrum of
user inquiries and improving internal knowledge handling. Results and
evaluation demonstrated technological innovation and feasibility, notably in
communication about the track and trace of a parcel, which exceeded initial
expectations. These advancements highlight the potential of AI-driven solutions
in logistics, suggesting many opportunities for further refinement and broader
implementation within PostNL operational framework.

"Integrating Cognitive AI with Generative Models for Enhanced Question
  Answering in Skill-based Learning","  In online learning, the ability to provide quick and accurate feedback to
learners is crucial. In skill-based learning, learners need to understand the
underlying concepts and mechanisms of a skill to be able to apply it
effectively. While videos are a common tool in online learning, they cannot
comprehend or assess the skills being taught. Additionally, while Generative AI
methods are effective in searching and retrieving answers from a text corpus,
it remains unclear whether these methods exhibit any true understanding. This
limits their ability to provide explanations of skills or help with
problem-solving. This paper proposes a novel approach that merges Cognitive AI
and Generative AI to address these challenges. We employ a structured knowledge
representation, the TMK (Task-Method-Knowledge) model, to encode skills taught
in an online Knowledge-based AI course. Leveraging techniques such as Large
Language Models, Chain-of-Thought, and Iterative Refinement, we outline a
framework for generating reasoned explanations in response to learners'
questions about skills.

"Diversity is Strength: Mastering Football Full Game with Interactive
  Reinforcement Learning of Multiple AIs","  Training AI with strong and rich strategies in multi-agent environments
remains an important research topic in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The
AI's strength is closely related to its diversity of strategies, and this
relationship can guide us to train AI with both strong and rich strategies. To
prove this point, we propose Diversity is Strength (DIS), a novel DRL training
framework that can simultaneously train multiple kinds of AIs. These AIs are
linked through an interconnected history model pool structure, which enhances
their capabilities and strategy diversities. We also design a model evaluation
and screening scheme to select the best models to enrich the model pool and
obtain the final AI. The proposed training method provides diverse,
generalizable, and strong AI strategies without using human data. We tested our
method in an AI competition based on Google Research Football (GRF) and won the
5v5 and 11v11 tracks. The method enables a GRF AI to have a high level on both
5v5 and 11v11 tracks for the first time, which are under complex multi-agent
environments. The behavior analysis shows that the trained AI has rich
strategies, and the ablation experiments proved that the designed modules
benefit the training process.
